# AI Webscraping Platform — Polyglot, Modular, and Full Stack

This project is a modern, full-stack **AI-powered webscraping platform** built with a polyglot microservices architecture (Python, Go, and Node.js backends) and a responsive React frontend. It showcases advanced webscraping, microservices, concurrency, and AI/ML integration, demonstrating robust data collection, automated analysis, and real-time user interaction across a flexible cloud-native stack.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:**  
  React/Next.js dashboard for data visualization and user actions.

- **Backend:**  
  Microservices in:  
  - **Python:** ML/NLP & webscraping  
  - **Go:** High-concurrency scraping and orchestration  
  - **Node.js:** Dynamic web/automation tasks

- **AI/ML:**  
  Integrates NLP and machine learning (sentiment analysis, entity recognition, classification).

- **Communication:**  
  REST/GraphQL API gateway connecting frontend and polyglot backend.

- **Database:**  
  MongoDB/Postgres for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **DevOps:**  
  Dockerized for easy deployment, CI/CD pipeline ready.
